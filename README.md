## Problem description

In this project, we tackle the binary classification problem of detecting whether a given tweet is related to a disaster or not. Each tweet may contain informal language, abbreviations, hashtags, mentions, URLs, emojis, and other noisy content typical of social media, making this a challenging natural language processing task.

##### Project Objectives

- Train and compare different LSTM architectures for binary classification.

- Evaluate model performance using F1-Score and other metrics like AUC.

## Data description
The data is donwloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data competition. It is composed by the following files:
- Train: Contains the tweet in text and the label, also the location and keyword.
- Test folder: Contains the tweet in text, location and keyword, but not the label.
- sample_submission.csv: Is the file as example of the sumbission that we need to upload.
